# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
This project was completed by me during Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. My project has passed all the test cases and got excellent reviews from the reviewer.

"Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns" project have implementations of forward and backward propagation from scratch.Basically the motive of the project was to build solid foundations of neural networks.
During this project I observed and chose hyperparamaters to prevent both high bias as well as overfitting leading low validation loss.
Finally I attained expected results and my project submission was accepted and received great reviews from the project reviewer.
